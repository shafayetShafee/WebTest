				<p class="leading">Following on from a discussion as to which of the ‘Big Three’ was the most dominant at their peak, there comes a wider question. How do we decide, if ever, which player is the best of Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic? <br> First and foremost, the ‘Big Three’ could not have existed in their form today if they were in any way similar. From the earliest days of their careers, their motivation growing up, their backgrounds, their coaching and everything in between, Federer, Nadal and Djokovic represent three totally different blueprints for any young player to follow. To avoid embarking on three separate biographies here (no global pandemic is that long), we shall steer clear of that wider context. However, it is important to note that a sport like tennis demands character from its best players, arguably more than any other individual sport, and you cannot put a number on character. Otherwise, let’s take a look at their numbers.</p>

				<p class="leading">Firstly, of course, Roger Federer is five and six years older than 33-year old Rafael Nadal and 32-year-old Djokovic, and has therefore played over 300 more matches than the pair. This can be seen in the overall win percentages (including all tour-level ATP matches, Olympic matches, the Davis Cup and Laver Cup) of the three. As we can see here, all three men have very impressive winning percentages for their careers. Nadal has the best at 83.0%, barely edging out Djokovic’s 82.7% and Federer’s 82.2%.  While Federer is still at the top of the game, he is far from the top of his. It barely shows, though, in his 82% career win percentage – just one short of Djokovic and Nadal who are both around the 83% mark.<br> Federer is forever setting the benchmark of when it is possible to continue as an elite tennis player and his fitness, and therefore longevity, could be the key to setting potentially insurmountable records in both matches played and titles won. For a player whose silky shot-making completely revolutionised how a generation watch and play tennis, it is actually the science of the man, and not the skill, that could keep his name at the top.</p>

				<p class="leading">Nadal’s penchant for the red surface is legendary, with 58 of his total 85 titles giving him the undisputed crown of “Greatest Of All Time On Clay”. The Spaniard has a truly unbelievable 92% win percentage on clay for his entire career to date. To lose just 8% of your matches played on an entire swing of the season (in the main between April and May) after a 19-year professional career is surely insurmountable.				
				Nothing should be taken away from Federer’s 87% career win percentage on grass, including an incredible six years (2003-06 and 2009) in which he did not lose a match on the surface. Federer and Djokovic, The pair both have 11 hard court Grand Slams when combining their Australian Open and US Open records and Federer’s career percentage on hard courts is just one behind Djokovic’s, much like their overall career percentage.

				If you were desperate to separate the three on surfaces, though, you could look to their Grand Slam records. Novak Djokovic has won a record eight Australian Opens (hard), Nadal a record 12 French Opens (clay) and Federer a record eight Wimbledon titles on grass. With five, four and three US Opens apiece for Federer, Nadal and Djokovic respectively. Notably, the three have not been able to dominate the US Open as totally as they have the other three slams, apart from at Federer’s peak in which he won all five of his titles from 2004-08.</p>

				<p class="leading">Both Nadal and Djokovic have perfectly reasoned responses to Federer’s numbers, however. In terms of Grand Slams won, Rafael Nadal is just one away from the Swiss with 19 to Federer’s 20, and it is largely accepted that the Spaniard can surpass that total before he likely retires well before 38 years old. Federer’s last Grand Slam win came at the 2018 Australian Open at 36 and, if we use that as a benchmark, Nadal has at least three more Roland-Garros titles available to him, not to mention the other majors. His most recent title was the US Open, of course. Djokovic is two behind Nadal with 17 but, as discussed in the previous article, the Serb is almost certainly the man with the most remaining opportunities to set the Grand Slam titles record. <br> In terms of tour records, things become a little more complicated. Novak Djokovic is the only man to win all nine ATP Masters 1000 events in the open era. The Serb has also won the year-end ATP Finals five times. His five ATP Finals are bested only by Roger Federer, who currently holds the record at six. The Swiss also holds vastly more ATP 500 and 250 titles than both Djokovic and Nadal, although this is symptomatic of his age. Rafael Nadal holds the most Masters titles with 35, one more than Djokovic at this stage, but has remarkably never won the ATP Finals.</p>

				<p class="leading">Matches between any of the ‘Big Three’ are almost always an instant classic, and can often come down to the better player on the day – with a whole host of outside factors to consider. It would be a fairer comparison, for example, if all three players were the same age, turned professional at the same time and had met each other on an equal spread of all three surfaces.Novak Djokovic holds a positive win percentage over both Roger Federer (54%) and Rafael Nadal (53%). This can be explained in a multitude of fashions but a few more obvious reasons to discuss are his relative youth and his style of play. As the youngest of the three, Djokovic has been in his ‘prime’ for the longest amount of time whilst facing Federer and Nadal, especially against the Swiss, who had been playing professionally for almost 10 years by the time Djokovic claimed his first win against him in the 2007 Rogers Cup final. Elsewhere here, Rafael Nadal owns the largest percentage over another member of the ‘Big Three’ with his outstanding 24-16 record against Roger Federer.</p>

				The important message to take away from all this Viz and Stats is that all three of Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic have different stakes to claim in the ‘GOAT’ debate, and none of them are finished. How should we decide who is the best of the three? Why should we? The ability of any one of them to beat the other is what has created this golden era for men's tennis and it should be celebrated for as long as possible. We should not trivialise the question, nor should we dismiss it. We should embrace it and debate it with passion and fervour for years to come and we should never fear getting it wrong. We should only fear the very real possibility that as tennis fans, as sport fans, we shall never have it so good.
